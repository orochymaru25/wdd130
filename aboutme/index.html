        Hi, I live in Bacolod City, Philippines. I am happy to be enrolled at
        BYU-I, taking Applied Technology WDD. I am a freelance worker and love
        doing business. My hobbies are playing computer games and traveling.

        I have been a member of this church for almost a decade. I served a mission in Cagayan De Oro last 2014-2016. Since then I enjoyed my membership in the church. A lot of activities and duties and responsibities that I served in my capacity.

        The BYU-Pathway Connect Worldwide opens a great opportunity for me
        to achieve my dream in the future. So I plan to continue my education since I only finished a vocational
        course. Hoping that everyone is doing well and
        I appreciate you all. Thank you.
    </p>
